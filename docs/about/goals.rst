Waffle's goals
==============

.. note::

    This document is a work in progress. See :ref:`the roadmap
    <about-roadmap>`, too.

Waffle is designed to

- support continuous integration and deployment,
- support feature rollout,
- with minimum set-up time and learning,
- while covering common segments,
- and being fast and robust enough for production use.

Waffle is **not** designed to

- be secure, or be a replacement for permissions,
- cover all potential segments.
